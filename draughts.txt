* Center pieces are stronger

Formations:
    * e.g. 3 neighbor pieces on the same diagonal
    * Balance the pieces in an even distribution on the board
    * Diagonal columns
    * Outposts can be dangerous (solo pieces) in the 6th row // TOO HARD
    * Tempi - who's more advanced? (manhattan distance to king of all pieces) // Kings > tempi
    * King defence (break through)
    * Killer draughts
    * Baseline pieces are important
    * Middle of the board more weight (not much)
